Ashfall is a survival, camping and needs mod for Morrowind. It uses the latest in MWSE Lua scripting functionality to implement a wide range of mechanics that integrate seamlessly into the game and provide a truly immersive experience. Build campfires, pitch tents, battle the elements, all while managing your thirst, hunger and tiredness. 

## Installation ##

Requirements:
- Vanilla Morrowind with Expansions and patches
- [MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102)
- [Skills Module](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034)

Unzip into the Morrowind folder or use a mod installer. 

## Instructions

- To get started, purchase some camping equipment from a trader (such as Arille). At the very least you will want a bedroll, a bottle, a cooking pot and an axe. 

- To collect water, with a bottle, flask or jug in your inventory, walk up to a body of water and press activate.

- To harvest firewood, go into the wilderness (where it is not illegal to sleep), and chop at a tree with an axe. Keep chopping until you collect ~7 firewood.

- To create a campfire, place some firewood on the ground (keep at least 3 in your inventory for supports), activate it and select "create campfire".

- Activate the campfire to enter the menu. Light the fire, add supports, then add your cooking pot. Fill the pot with the dirty water you collected and wait for it to boil.

- Once boiled, you can add ingredients to the cooking pot to make a stew.
